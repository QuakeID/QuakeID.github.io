This tutorial is being designed for a 1-day workshop. It is intended to provide a very brief introduction to tectonic modelling using continuum models. The target audience are structural geologists without a lot of previous knowledge of modelling. The main goal is to introduce the main concepts and to play around with a toy code to provide a hands-on experience. The coverage of the different subjects is therefore very short and by no means exhaustive.

## FAQs

{{< spoiler text="Do I need to do anything in advance?" >}}
The codes in this workshop will be based on Matlab. Therefore it would be good if you have a recent version of Matlab installed and if you had a working knowledge of Matlab.
