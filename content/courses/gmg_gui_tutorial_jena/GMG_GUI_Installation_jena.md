In this workshop, we will mainly work with the Matlab version of the Data Picker app. We will also have a short look at the julia Data Picker app. Both apps are still under development, but we are aiming at a final julia app. This is simply because Matlab is not a free software, which restricts the usage of the Matlab app.


## 1. MATLAB apps
To install the two apps within MATLAB, first download them by accessing the [course materials](https://unibt-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/bt303651_myubt_de/EqrYg8m7m5NGpXZryfHaWKEBh3cw5iUU9Mn5dSptLYCYzQ?e=mZA3WG). There you'll find a folder named Apps. In this folder, you can then download both the GeoDataPicker app and the ProfileSelection app. Install both from within Matlab.

 ## Julia app
 The julia Data Picker App is contained in a julia package. Further details on how to install it can be found on the [github page](https://github.com/JuliaGeodynamics/GeoDataPicker.jl).
