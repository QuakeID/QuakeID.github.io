<div align="justify">
I am the group leader of the Emmy Noether Research Group QuakeID at the Bavarian Research Institute of Experimental Geochemistry and Geophysics (BGI) at the University of Bayreuth. My research interests include deep earthquakes, flow of complex fluids through porous media and the rheology of Earth's lower mantle. I pursue an interdisciplinary approach to those subjects, my main tool being numerical modelling, combined with laboratory and field data.
I am particularly interested in the interplay between different microscale processes and their impact on macroscale deformation. Understanding these feedback loops in the context of ductile failure in the mantle and lithosphere is crucial to better understand the seismic hazard originating from both deep earthquakes and shallow slow slip events, the formation of plate boundaries, but also to decipher the Earth's deep water cycle.
