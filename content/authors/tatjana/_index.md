<div align="justify">
I am interested in earthquakes occurrence and its mechanisms as well as the rock rheology and deformation in the Earthâ€™s crust and upper mantle.
In my PhD, I am working on tectonic environments favouring intermediate-depth earthquake generation by using numerical modelling. I will concentrate on the impact of coupled grain size reduction, shear heating and hydration processes causing deep earthquakes on subducting slabs and parameters for plate detachment. I will apply these to the Hindu Kush region and try to model its earthquake cycle.
