<div align="justify">
I am a developer and user of numerical models to investigate processes in the Earth's crust and upper mantle. My research interests include the feedback between shear heating and temperature-dependent rheologies as well as grain size evolution. In combination, these processes can lead to ductile localization of deformation, a mechanism facilitating the occurence of deep earthquakes. To accomplish that, I work with 1D and 2D, GPU-based codes, utilizing pseudo-transient solvers to account for nonlinear rheologies. For my PhD, I used thermomechanical models to investigate the dynamics of crustal magmatic systems, integrating different geophysical observations and petrological constraints.
