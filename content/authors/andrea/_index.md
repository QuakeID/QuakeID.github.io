# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I'm currently working on slab break-off dynamics and the effect of slab break-off on the lithosphere (stress state and surface response). In the past I have worked on the geodynamic implications of continental crust generation during the Archean and on the evolution of the orogens as a function of climate forcing. 

interests: 
- slab break-off
- magmatic processes
- surface response and basin generation 
- rheology
- Orogenesis and metamorphic petrology

<div align="justify">
I am a postdoctoral researcher in Marcel Thielmann's research group. My current research project is concerned with the physical controlsconcern the effects of slab-break off physical controls on the surface response and on the overall architecture of orogenetic belts (QDis project). I'm particular interested in non-linear processes spanning from small to large scales and use numerical forward modelling as a mean to understand them.

My research interests are particularly concerning the interaction between mountain building processes, post-collisional evolution and surface processes. I'm currently collaborating with the research group of Prof. Dr. Nevena Andrić Tomašević to decipher the surface and sedimentological signal of slab-break off, using a combination of different forward numerical techniques.
