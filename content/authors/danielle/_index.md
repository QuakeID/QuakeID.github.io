I am a PhD student in Marcel Thielmann's research group, specializing in high-pressure, high-temperature deformation experiments using a 6-ram multi-anvil press. My current project is focus on studying the deformation of synthetic olivine and natural serpentinite aggregates under subduction zone conditions, exploring their mechanisms and potential phase transitions that may contribute to intermediate-deep earthquakes. In my master's projects, I participated in a geochemical study of Seymchan pallasite and conducted experimental deformation of analogue materials to understand the origin of these unique meteorites. For my master's thesis, I optimized optical measurements in Diamond Anvil Cells (DACs) to improve equations of state determinations for glassy and crystalline materials, contributing to high-pressure physics and material science. Additionally, I utilized Transmission and Scanning Electron Microscopy to identify twins and dislocations in naturally deformed quartz.
