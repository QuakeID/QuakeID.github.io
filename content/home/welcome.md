The Emmy Noether Research Group  <strong>QuakeID </strong> aims at deciphering the rupture processes of deep earthquakes which occur at depths larger than 60 km. The first observations of these events go back to 1928 (by Kiyoo Wadati), yet there is no consensus on what processes cause them. To solve this long-standing problem, we employ an interdisciplinary approach where numerical simulations will be combined with novel high pressure laboratory experiments and seismological observations.
