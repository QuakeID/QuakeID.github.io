At the [19th Symposium on „Tectonics, Structural Geology and Crystalline Geology“](https://tsk19.geo.uni-halle.de/), Marcel gave a 1-day short course to introduce the basic concepts of numerical modelling and provide some hands-on experience of working with a modelling code. The corresponding lecture slides and codes will be uploaded here soon.
