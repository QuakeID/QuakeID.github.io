summary: Talk given at the German-Swiss Geodynamics Workshop
abstract: "The detachment of subducting slabs has been frequently invoked to explain different phenomenasuchasmagmatism,rapidexhumationofmetamorphicrocks,topographicupliftand the occurence of intermediate-depth earthquakes. Despite its potential importance for all these phenomena,theslabdetachmentprocessisstillincompletelyunderstood,inparticularinrelation to ductile weakening mechanisms.

Here, we therefore investigate the impact of three coupled weakening mechanisms on the viscous detachment of a stalled lithospheric slab: structural weakening due to necking, material weakening due to grain size reduction (using a two-phase grain damage model) and thermal weakening due to shear heating. We consider a combined flow law of dislocation and diffusion creep. To understand and quantify the coupling of these three nonlinear weakening processes, we derive a mathematical model, which consists of three coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations describing the evolution of slab thickness, grain size and temperature. Using dimensional analysis, we determine the dimensionless parameters which control the relative importance of the three weakening processes and the two creep mechanisms. We derive several analytical solutions for end-member scenarios that predict the detachment time, that is the duration of slab detachment until slab thickness becomes zero.

Furthermore, we use numerical solutions of the system of equations to systematically explore theparameterspacewithaMonteCarloapproach.Comparisontotheanalyticalpredictionshows that they are capable of predicting slab detachment times, even for scenarios where all three weakening and both creep mechanisms are important. At worst, the deviation of the analytical predictions from the numerical results amounts to 50 %.

When both grain and thermal damage are important, the two damage processes generate a positive feedback loop resulting in the fastest detachment times. For Earth -like conditions, we find that the onset of slab detachment is controlled by grain damage and that during later stages of slab detachment thermal weakening becomes increasingly important and can become the dominating weakening process. We therefore argue that both grain and thermal damage are important for slab detachment and that both damage processes could also be important for lithosphere necking during continental rifting leading to break-up and ocean formation."
