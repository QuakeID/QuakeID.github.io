Despite their distance from the surface, large deep earthquakes represent a considerable seismic hazard. These earthquakes are particularly intriguing, as unattainably large forces are required to break rocks at those depths, a problem that was already recognized by K. Wadati in 1928. In the 90 years that passed since, different hypotheses have surfaced to explain these events, but despite the wealth of observational data and laboratory experiments, the underlying nucleation and rupture mechanisms of deep earthquakes remain enigmatic. To solve this long-standing problem, QuakeID will employ an interdisciplinary approach with numerical modelling at its core. Numerical simulations will be combined with novel laboratory experiments and seismological observations, to upscale results from the laboratory to the Earth. For this, cutting edge numerical models will be developed that can be applied at both seismic and geological time scales to model deep earthquake rupture. Together with specifically designed high pressure/high temperature experiments, they will be used to\ndetermine the conditions which favour deep earthquake generation, determine the rupture mechanism(s) responsible for earthquake nucleation at the respective depth, identify feedbacks between different rupture mechanism, test the hypothesis that a cascade of rupture mechanisms is responsible for generating large deep earthquakes and provide synthetic results that can be compared to seismological and geological observations. QuakeID will thus solve the crucial research problem of how deep earthquakes are generated, which will improve seismic hazard assessment and, more generally, contribute to a better understanding of the stability of deep geothermal reservoirs as well as general non-brittle failure processes in material science.

The idea for the Geophysical Model Generator was born out of the need to view different geophysical datasets (e.g. tomographies, gravity measurements, receiver functions and others) in a single joint manner without having to resort to specifically programmed visualization routines for each case.\nImporting Data 1. Data sources Before you can use GMG, you obviously need data. Given the different kinds of data available, there is a multitude of sources. Here, we list some of them that may be useful in the future:\nCreating Cross Sections In scientific publications that deal with seismic tomographies, the results are often shown in 2D horizontal and vertical cross sections (slices and profiles). The Geophysical Model Generator therefore also provides tools do exactly this.\nExporting Data 1. Exporting Data Now that you know how to import data and how to extract cross sections from it, you may want to export it to a format that can be imported into e.\nVisualization To show you how to visualize data, we will use one of the exmaples given in the GMG documentation.

Introduction In this short tutorial, we will introduce the Geophysical Model Generator (GMG). GMG was developed to import and process different kinds of geophysical data. These datasets can then be exported and visualized in Paraview.\nThe main focus of this tutorial is to learn the basics of the programming language Julia and to show how geophysical datasets can be imported using the tools provided by the Geophysical Model Generator (with the focus on seismic tomographies). At the end, we will also shortly show some basic visualization of selected datasets in Paraview.\nThe Julia scientific programming language is fast, completely open source and comes with a nice package manager. It works on essentially all systems and has an extremely active user base. Programming in Julia is fairly easy and comparable to programming in MATLAB. If you have experience in MATLAB programming, transitioning to Julia should be relatively smooth.\nWe are assuming that you are not yet familiar with Julia. The purpose of these exercises is therefore to give you a crash course in how to install it on your system, create a few programs, make plots etc.\n2. Installing Julia The best way to start is to download a recent version of julia (1.6.3) from https://julialang.org (use a binary installer). The recommended debugger for julia is Microsoft Visual Studio Code, where you should install the julia extension. See this page for more info.\nOnce this is done (in the order indicated above), you can start the Julia REPL (which stands for read-eval-print-loop, similar to the command window in MATLAB) by typing in the Command Palette (which you find in VS Code under the menu View-\u0026gt;Command Palette):\n\u0026gt;Julia: Start REPL This will take a bit of time initially, as it needs to compile. Once that is done, you should see the following:\n3. First steps Let’s start with some simple calculations within the REPL\njulia\u0026gt; 2+3 julia\u0026gt; 3*4 julia\u0026gt; 5^2 Powers are performed before division and multiplication, which are done before subtraction and addition.\njulia\u0026gt; 2+3*4^2 The arrow keys allow ‘command-line editing’ which cuts down on the amount of typing required, and allows easy error correction. Press the “up” arrow, and add /2. What will this produce?\njulia\u0026gt; 2+3*4^2/2 Parentheses may be used to group terms, or to make them more readable.\njulia\u0026gt; (2+3*4^2)/2 The equality sign is used to assign values to variables.\njulia\u0026gt; a = 3 julia\u0026gt; b = a^2 julia\u0026gt; a/b If no other name is given, an answer is saved in a variable named ans\njulia\u0026gt; a/b 3.0 julia\u0026gt; ans 3.0 julia\u0026gt; c=2*ans 6.0 julia\u0026gt; ans 6.0 We can always determine the type of a value with\njulia\u0026gt; typeof(a) Int64 which shows that a is an integer value. If we define a as:\njulia\u0026gt; a = 2.1 julia\u0026gt; typeof(a) Float64 which shows that now a is a double precision number.\n3.1 Vectors So far we dealt with scalar values. Working with vectors in Julia is simple:\njulia\u0026gt; x=0:.1:2 0.0:0.1:2.0 We can retrieve a particular value in the vector x by using square brackets:\njulia\u0026gt; x[3] 0.2 Arrays in julia start at 1:\njulia\u0026gt; x[1] 0.0 You can perform computations with x:\njulia\u0026gt; y = x.^2 .+ 1 21-element Vector{Float64}: 0.0 0.010000000000000002 0.04000000000000001 0.09 0.16000000000000003 0.25 0.36 0.48999999999999994 ⋮ 1.9599999999999997 2.25 2.5600000000000005 2.8899999999999997 3.24 3.61 4.0 Note the dot . here, which tells julia that every entry of x should be squared and 1 is added. If you want a vector with values, they should be separated by commas:\njulia\u0026gt; a=[1.2, 3, 5, 6] 4-element Vector{Float64}: 1.2 3.0 5.0 6.0 3.2 Matrixes A matrix in julia can be defined as\njulia\u0026gt; a = [1 2 3; 4 5 6] 2×3 Matrix{Int64}: 1 2 3 4 5 6 Note that the elements of a matrix being entered are enclosed by brackets; a matrix is entered in “row-major order” (i.e. all of the first row, then all of the second row, etc); rows are separated by a semicolon (or a newline), and the elements of the row should be separated by a space.\nThe element in the i’th row and j’th column of a is referred to in the usual way:\njulia\u0026gt; a[1,2] 2 The transpose of a matrix is the result of interchanging rows and columns. Julia denotes the transpose by folowing the matrix with the single-quote [apostrophe].\njulia\u0026gt; a\u0026#39; 3×2 adjoint(::Matrix{Int64}) with eltype Int64: 1 4 2 5 3 6 New matrices may be formed out of old ones, in many ways.\njulia\u0026gt; c = [a; 7 8 9] 3×3 Matrix{Int64}: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 julia\u0026gt; [a; a; a] 6×3 Matrix{Int64}: 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 julia\u0026gt; [a a a] 2×9 Matrix{Int64}: 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 4 5 6 4 5 6 There are many built.-in matrix constructions. Here are a few:\njulia\u0026gt; rand(1,3) 1×3 Matrix{Float64}: 0.0398622 0.229126 0.148148 julia\u0026gt; rand(2) 2-element Vector{Float64}: 0.668085153596309 0.4275013437388613 julia\u0026gt; zeros(3) 3-element Vector{Float64}: 0.0 0.0 0.0 julia\u0026gt; ones(3,2) 3×2 Matrix{Float64}: 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 Use a semicolon to suppress output within the REPL:\njulia\u0026gt; s = zeros(20,30); This is useful, when working with large matrices.\nAn often used …","date":1635202800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635202800,"objectID":"584dce7b255a79c50cf08058f3c1ace1","permalink":"https://QuakeID.github.io/courses/gmg_tutorial/introjulia/","publishdate":"2021-10-26T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/courses/gmg_tutorial/introjulia/","section":"courses","summary":"1.

What is the Geophysical Model Generator? The idea for the Geophysical Model Generator was born out of the need to view different geophysical datasets (e.g. tomographies, gravity measurements, receiver functions and others) in a single joint manner without having to resort to specifically programmed visualization routines for each case. The Geophysical Model Generator is NOT a single program, but can rather be seen as a set of tools (written in julia) that allow to import and modify different datasets and transfer them to a common data structure. This common data structure then allows to process and visualize the different datasets in a coherent manner, thus facilitating comparisons and interpretations. In addition, the GMG provides tools to assist numerical modellers in creating input models from these datasets.\nFor this, the julia module GeophysicalModelGenerator.jl provides the following functionality:\nA consistent GeoData structure, that holds the data along with lon/lat/depth information. Routines to generate VTK files from the GeoData structure in order to visualize results in Paraview. The ability to deal with points, 2D profiles and 3D volumes, for both scalar and vector values. Rapidly import screenshots of published papers compare them with other data sets in 3D using paraview. Create geodynamic input models (for LaMEM) 2. Installation To install GeophysicalModelGenerator.jl, start julia and go to the package manager:\njulia\u0026gt; ] (@v1.6) pkg\u0026gt; add GeophysicalModelGenerator This will automatically install various other packages it relies on (using the correct version).\nIf you want, you can test if it works on your machine by running the test suite in the package manager:\njulia\u0026gt; ] (@v1.6) pkg\u0026gt; test GeophysicalModelGenerator Note that we run these tests automatically on Windows, Linux and Mac every time we add a new feature to GeophysicalModelGenerator (using different julia versions). This Continuous Integration (CI) ensures that new features do not break others in the package. The results can be seen here.\nThe installation of GMG only needs to be done once, and will precompile the package and all other dependencies.\nIf you, at a later stage, want to upgrade to the latest version of GMG, you can type:\njulia\u0026gt; ] (@v1.6) pkg\u0026gt; update GeophysicalModelGenerator You can load GeophysicalModelGenerator, for example to create cross-sections, with:\njulia\u0026gt; using GeophysicalModelGenerator 3. Dependencies We rely on a number of additional packages. All of them are automatically installed, except GeoParams.jl, which you currenty have to add yourself, again using the package manager.\nGeoParams.jl Defines dimensional units, and makes it easy to convert for km/s to m/s, etc. WriteVTK.jl writes VTK files (to be opened with Paraview). ImageIO.jl, FileIO.jl, Colors.jl to import screenshots from papers. Interpolations.jl for interpolations (for example related to importing screenshots).

Data sources Before you can use GMG, you obviously need data. Given the different kinds of data available, there is a multitude of sources. Here, we list some of them that may be useful in the future:\nMB4D Data Repository: Repository for data obtained within SPP 4DMB ETOPO1: Global relief data with a resolution of 1 arc-minute IRIS Earth Model Collaboration: Different Earth Models, in particular a large collection of seismic tomographies our own database: a collection of different data which we have already processed with GMG and many more… A lot of data is also not available via dedicated repositories, but via more general repositories such as Zenodo or even hosted on private websites. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will now focus on data from seismic tomographies. For the European Alps, there are several datasets which are freely available. Here, we will use the dataset by Paffrath et al. which uses AlpArray data. The data is not yet available for download in a public repository, but will soon be. Here we use a simple text file with the data that was provided to us directly by Marcel Paffrath.\nPaffrath, M., Friederich, W., and the AlpArray and AlpArray-Swath D working group: Imaging structure and geometry of slabs in the greater Alpine area – A P-wave traveltime tomography using AlpArray Seismic Network data, Solid Earth Discuss. [preprint], https://doi.org/10.5194/se-2021-58, in review, 2021.\n2. Importing tomographic data given as ASCII file To start importing data, we start the Julia REPL as described in the first part of the tutorial. We then load the DelimitedFiles and the GeophysicalModelGenerator packages:\njulia\u0026gt; using DelimitedFiles, GeophysicalModelGenerator, GeoStats To import the Paffrath dataset, read it using the function readdlm:\njulia\u0026gt; data = readdlm(\u0026#34;./vgrid_it12_w_res.txt\u0026#34;,skipstart=1) This results in a large matrix where the data is stored. As a next step, we will organize this data a bit more:\njulia\u0026gt; lon = data[:,1]; julia\u0026gt; lat = data[:,2]; julia\u0026gt; depth = -data[:,3]; julia\u0026gt; Vp = data[:,4]; julia\u0026gt; dVp = data[:,5]; To process this data, we still have to transfer it to a matrix format. To do so, we first generate a regular 3D grid:\nDepth_vec = unique(depth) Lon,Lat,Depth = LonLatDepthGrid(0:0.5:21,37:0.25:51,Depth_vec); Here, we generate a grid that has a longitude range from 0° to 20°, a latitude range from 37° to 21° and a depth range determined by the data.\nTo transfer the data in matrix format, we then employ the GeoStats.jl package, which basically interpolates the data from the given data points to the grid:\njulia\u0026gt; dLon = Lon[2,1,1]-Lon[1,1,1] julia\u0026gt; dLat = Lat[1,2,1]-Lat[1,1,1] julia\u0026gt; Cgrid = CartesianGrid((size(Lon,1),size(Lon,2)),(minimum(Lon),minimum(Lat)),(dLon,dLat)) julia\u0026gt; Vp_3D = zeros(size(Depth)); julia\u0026gt; dVp_3D = zeros(size(Depth)); julia\u0026gt; for iz=1:size(Depth,3) julia\u0026gt; println(\u0026#34;Depth = $(Depth[1,1,iz])\u0026#34;) julia\u0026gt; ind = findall(x -\u0026gt; x==Depth[1,1,iz], depth) julia\u0026gt; coord = PointSet([lon[ind]\u0026#39;; lat[ind]\u0026#39;]) julia\u0026gt; Geo = georef((Vp=Vp[ind],), coord) julia\u0026gt; P = EstimationProblem(Geo, Cgrid, :Vp) julia\u0026gt; S = IDW(:Vp =\u0026gt; (distance=Euclidean(),neighbors=2)); julia\u0026gt; sol = solve(P, S) julia\u0026gt; sol_Vp= values(sol).Vp julia\u0026gt; Vp_2D = reshape(sol_Vp, size(domain(sol))) julia\u0026gt; Vp_3D[:,:,iz] = Vp_2D; julia\u0026gt; # dVp julia\u0026gt; Geo = georef((dVp=dVp[ind],), coord) julia\u0026gt; P = EstimationProblem(Geo, Cgrid, :dVp) julia\u0026gt; S = IDW(:dVp =\u0026gt; (distance=Euclidean(),neighbors=2)); julia\u0026gt; sol = solve(P, S) julia\u0026gt; sol_dVp= values(sol).dVp julia\u0026gt; dVp_2D = reshape(sol_dVp, size(domain(sol))) julia\u0026gt; dVp_3D[:,:,iz] = dVp_2D; julia\u0026gt; end We have now interpolated both Vp as well as dVp to the 3D grid. What is now left is to put the data in the GMG format:\njulia\u0026gt; Data_Paffrath = GeophysicalModelGenerator.GeoData(Lon,Lat,Depth,(Vp_km_s=Vp_3D,dVp_perc=dVp_3D)) Now store the imported and interpolated data in GMG format so that you can work with it later. This is done using the JLD2.jl package:\njulia\u0026gt; using JLD2 julia\u0026gt; jldsave(\u0026#34;Paffrath_Europe.jld2\u0026#34;; Data_Paffrath) If you, at a later stage, want to load this file again do it as follows:\njulia\u0026gt; using JLD2, GeophysicalModelGenerator julia\u0026gt; Data_Paffrath_ = load_object(\u0026#34;Paffrath_Europe.jld2\u0026#34;) You can also find the above workflow in this file: ReadDataPaffrath.jl. To run it, do the following:\njulia\u0026gt; include(\u0026#34;ReadDataPaffrath.jl\u0026#34;) Make sure to put the data file vgrid_it12_w_res.txt in the same directory.\n3. Importing tomographic data given as netCDF As mentioned above, netCDF is a standardized file dormat that is widely used in geoscientifc applications. As an example, we will here import the velocity model of the Collaborative Seismic Earth Model (CSEM, Fichtner et al., 2018), which has been constructed using multi-scale full seismic waveform inversion. This model is available via the IRIS EMC Database and can be downloaded here. The original work behind this dataset is:\nBlom, N. and Gokhberg, A. and Fichtner, A., 202.

Creating horizontal cross sections (slices) Once you have loaded the required data, creating a horizontal slice is quite easy using the GMG tool CrossSection. To extract a horizontal slice at a given depth, simply call the function as in the example below:\njulia\u0026gt; Data_Paffrath_d100 = CrossSection(Data_Paffrath, Depth_level=-100km) where the first argument to the function is the GMG data structure and the second argument denotes the kind of cross section to be extracted. The key word Depth_level denotes that a horizontal slice is to be extracted, with its depth value being -100 km (note that depth is negative).\n2. Creating vertical cross sections (profiles) Creating a vertical cross section is similarly straightforward, the only difference being that in this case, the starting and ending point of the cross section has to be provided:\njulia\u0026gt; Data_Paffrath_A = CrossSection(Data_Paffrath, Start=(4.65,45.73), End=(17.23,43.80)) Where the start and end points have to be given as (longitude,latitude) pairs.

Exporting Data Now that you know how to import data and how to extract cross sections from it, you may want to export it to a format that can be imported into e.g. Paraview. This has been done already at several instances during this tutorial, but we state it here again for completeness. Exporting data to vts format (which can be imported to Paraview) can be done using the function Write_Paraview.\nBased on the previous part of the tutorial, you may want to export the whole block of the imported tomography.

We will repeat it here for completeness. The example is the P-wave velocity model of the Alps as described in:\nZhao, L., Paul, A., Malusà, M.G., Xu, X., Zheng, T., Solarino, S., Guillot, S., Schwartz, S., Dumont, T., Salimbeni, S., Aubert, C., Pondrelli, S., Wang, Q., Zhu, R., 2016.

Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 121, 8720–8737. doi:10.1002/2016JB013310\nThe data is given in ASCII format with longitude/latitude/depth/velocity anomaly (percentage) format. You can find the processed data here.\n1. Visualizing data with Paraview Importing data into Paraview is fairly straightforward, as one simply needs to open the desired vts file. In our case, open the file Zhao_etal_2016_dVp_percentage.vts. in Paraview. Press Apply (left menu) after doing that. Once you did that you can select dVp_Percentage and Surface (see red ellipses below)/.\nThis visualisation employs the default colormap, which is not particularly good.\nYou can change that by importing the roma colormap (link). For this, open the colormap editor and click the one with the heart on the right hand side. Next, import roma and select it. Alternatively, use one of the already provided colormaps.\nIn order to change the color range select the button in the red ellipse and change the lower/upper bound. If you want to create a horizontal cross-section @ 200 km depth, you need to select the Slice tool, select Sphere as a clip type, set the center to [0,0,0] and set the radius to 6171 (=radius earth - 200 km).\nAfter pushing Apply, you’ll see this:\nIf you want to plot iso-surfaces (e.g. at -3%), you can use the Clip option again, but this time select scalar and don’t forget to unclick invert.\n2. Visualizing cross sections In principle, Paraview allows to create cross sections of given data. However, Paraview operates in Cartesian coordinates, which makes it difficult to create arbitrary cross-sections with given longitude and latitude. As we have already covered in this tutorial, there is a simple way to create cross sections using the CrossSection function. Here we will go through creating different cross-sections, exporting them and to visualize them in Paraview.\nFirst, go to the directory where the data is located, start up julia and load the JLD2 and GeophyicalModelGenerator package. Then, load the data that we have already converted to GMG format:\njulia\u0026gt; using GeophysicalModelGenerator,JLD2 julia\u0026gt; load_object(\u0026#34;Zhao_Pwave.jld2\u0026#34;) Below, we list the commands needed to create different cross-sections.\nTo make a cross-section at a given depth:\njulia\u0026gt; Data_cross = CrossSection(Data_set, Depth_level=-100km) GeoData size : (121, 94, 1) lon ϵ [ 0.0 : 18.0] lat ϵ [ 38.0 : 51.95] depth ϵ [ -101.0 km : -101.0 km] fields: (:dVp_Percentage,) julia\u0026gt; Write_Paraview(Data_cross, \u0026#34;Zhao_CrossSection_100km\u0026#34;) 1-element Vector{String}: \u0026#34;Zhao_CrossSection_100km.vts\u0026#34; Or at a specific longitude:\njulia\u0026gt; Data_cross = CrossSection(Data_set, Lon_level=10) GeoData size : (1, 94, 101) lon ϵ [ 10.05 : 10.05] lat ϵ [ 38.0 : 51.95] depth ϵ [ -1001.0 km : -1.0 km] fields: (:dVp_Percentage,) julia\u0026gt; Write_Paraview(Data_cross, \u0026#34;Zhao_CrossSection_Lon10\u0026#34;) 1-element Vector{String}: \u0026#34;Zhao_CrossSection_Lon10.vts\u0026#34; As you see, this cross-section is not taken at exactly 10 degrees longitude. That is because by default we don’t interpolate the data, but rather use the closest point in longitude in the original data set.\nIf you wish to interpolate the data, specify Interpolate=true:\njulia\u0026gt; Data_cross = CrossSection(Data_set, Lon_level=10, Interpolate=true) GeoData size : (1, 100, 100) lon ϵ [ 10.0 : 10.0] lat ϵ [ 38.0 : 51.95] depth ϵ [ -1001.0 km : -1.0 km] fields: (:dVp_Percentage,) julia\u0026gt; Write_Paraview(Data_cross, \u0026#34;Zhao_CrossSection_Lon10_interpolated\u0026#34;); as you see, this causes the data to be interpolated on a (100,100) grid (which can be changed by adding a dims input parameter).\nWe can also create a diagonal cut through the model:\njulia\u0026gt; Data_cross = CrossSection(Data_set, Start=(1.0,39), End=(18,50)) GeoData size : (100, 100, 1) lon ϵ [ 1.0 : 18.0] lat ϵ [ 39.0 : 50.0] depth ϵ [ -1001.0 km : -1.0 km] fields: (:dVp_Percentage,) julia\u0026gt; Write_Paraview(Data_cross, \u0026#34;Zhao_CrossSection_diagonal\u0026#34;) Here an image that shows the resulting cross-sections:\n3. Extract a (3D) subset of the data Sometimes, the data set covers a large region (e.g., the whole Earth), and you are only interested in a subset of this data for your project. You can obviously cut your data to the correct size in Paraview. Yet, an even easier way is the routine ExtractSubvolume:\njulia\u0026gt; Data_subset = ExtractSubvolume(Data_set,Lon_level=(5,12), Lat_level=(40,45)) GeoData size : (48, 35, 101) lon ϵ [ 4.95 : 12.0] lat ϵ [ 39.95 : 45.05] depth ϵ [ -1001.0 km : -1.0 km] fields: (:dVp_Percentage,) julia\u0026gt; Write_Paraview(Data_subset, \u0026#34;Zhao_Subset\u0026#34;) This gives the …","date":1636153200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1636153200,"objectID":"a8420a927e515809f640c1a63211b7bf","permalink":"https://QuakeID.github.io/courses/gmg_tutorial/gmg_vis/","publishdate":"2021-11-06T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/courses/gmg_tutorial/gmg_vis/","section":"courses","summary":"To show you how to visualize data, we will use one of the exmaples given in the GMG documentation.

We determined the spatial and temporal evolution of strain and strain rate by basing numerical simulations on experimentally derived microstructures, and thereby identified characteristic deformation mechanisms. Pure omphacite and garnet aggregates deform by two different mechanisms. Internally strained clasts and low-angle grain boundaries indicate crystal plasticity for omphacitite; the fracture dominated fabric of garnetite documents brittle deformation. Electron channeling contrast imaging, however, revealed low-angle grain boundaries and free dislocations in garnet crystals, suggesting that minor crystal plasticity accompanies the brittle failure. Eclogitic aggregates show varying deformation behavior between the two end-members shifting from crystal plastic toward brittle deformation with increasing garnet content. All samples exhibit strain weakening. The intensity of weakening shows a positive correlation with the garnet content. Our combined experimental, numerical, and microstructural investigations suggest that the majority of strain weakening is associated with crystal plastic processes in omphacite. Numerical simulations and experiments show that a garnet content above 25% enhances the activity of crystal plastic processes in omphacite and results in strain localization, which subsequently weakens the eclogite.","tags":null,"title":"The Effect of the Garnet Content on Deformation Mechanisms and Weakening of Eclogite: Insights From Deformation Experiments and Numerical Simulations","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The QuakeID team and collaborators from the Unversity of Frankfurt, the University of Mainz, ETH Zürich, UNIL Lausanne, LMU Munich and Université de Rennes will meet for a Julia hackathon on March 13-17, 2023 to advance different software projects.\nHackathon purpose In the hackathon, we will again join forces to continue developing several julia packages that have been started last year.\n","date":1676419200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676419200,"objectID":"cb78a840ae5e452a9ad18c3813f10e1e","permalink":"https://QuakeID.github.io/post/15-02-23_hackathon/","publishdate":"2023-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/15-02-23_hackathon/","section":"post","summary":"The QuakeID team and collaborators from the Unversity of Frankfurt, the University of Mainz, ETH Zürich, UNIL Lausanne, LMU Munich and Université de Rennes will meet for a Julia hackathon on March 13-17, 2023 to advance different software projects.\n","tags":null,"title":"Julia Hackathon","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Arne Spang has joined the team!

Drill cores of a natural antigorite‐serpentinite with a strong foliation were used in multi‐anvil experiments in the range of 2–5 GPa and 450–800°C. Fluids released upon dehydration are fixed by the formation of brucite in an adjacent fluid sink. The amount and distribution of brucite serves as a proxy for fluid flow. In our specific setup the sample reacted with the surrounding fluid sink to form an additional layer of olivine, which has the potential to limit fluid flux within our experiments. For conditions prior to serpentine dehydration we used Al(OH)3 as fluid source. Fluid in this experiment did not migrate through the serpentinite, indicating that serpentine has a low diffusivity. The experiments also show that small deviatoric stresses have an influence on the fluid flux and can cause an anisotropic fluid flux. Comparison between the time scales of the determined fluid flux with fluid production rates indicates fluid pressure buildup during dehydration reactions. Adjacent less permeable layers can inhibit fluid flux and cause fluid pressure buildup even at conditions when an interconnected pore space formed. Subduction zones are regions where tectonic plates are recycled into the Earth's interior. Prior to subduction, the plates experienced extensive chemical interaction with the ocean water, forming hydrous minerals. Serpentine is an important hydrous mineral that can transport significant amounts of water into the Earth's interior. During subduction both pressure and temperature increase whereby hydrous minerals break down and release their water. The fluid migrates into the overlying mantle wedge, where it accounts for hydration as well as melting processes. The global flux balances would require this process to be very effective. However, it was so far not possible to measure the fluid flux at the subduction zone conditions in laboratories. In this study, we present a new method to determine the fluid flux prior and during dehydration. We found that prior to dehydration, the fluid flux in serpentinites is small. During dehydration the rocks ability to let fluids pass through increases. However, adjacent rocks with a low ability for fluid transport can further inhibit a fluid flux at these conditions. Generally, our experimental setup can be used for any system that immobilizes migrating fluids by hydration reactions.

The main rock‐forming minerals in the lower mantle are bridgmanite (Br) and smaller amounts of ferropericlase (Fp). Previous work has suggested that the large differences in viscosity between these minerals greatly affect the bulk rock rheology. The resulting effective rheology becomes highly strain‐dependent as weaker Fp minerals become elongated and eventually interconnected. This implies that strain localization may occur in Earth's lower mantle. So far, there have been no studies on global‐scale mantle convection in the presence of such strain‐weakening (SW) rheology. Here, we present 2D numerical models of thermo‐chemical convection in spherical annulus geometry including a new strain‐dependent rheology formulation for lower mantle materials, combining rheological weakening and healing terms. We find that SW rheology has several direct and indirect effects on mantle convection. The most notable direct effect is the changing dynamics of weakened plume channels as well as the formation of larger thermochemical piles at the base of the mantle. The weakened plume conduits act as lubrication channels in the mantle and exhibit a lower thermal anomaly. SW rheology also reduces the overall viscosity, notable in terms of increasing convective vigor and core‐mantle boundary heat flux. Finally, we put our results into context with existing hypotheses on the style of mantle convection and mixing. Most importantly, we suggest that the new kind of plume dynamics may explain the discrepancy between expected and observed thermal anomalies of deep‐seated mantle plumes on Earth. Earth's lower mantle (660–2,890 km depth) controls our planet's evolution by regulating the transport of materials and heat through mantle convection. To better understand mantle convection and the evolution of Earth over billions of years, mathematical laws describing how rocks flow (viscosity) are needed. Recently, it was discovered that the deformation history of lower‐mantle rocks affects the viscosity. In the lower mantle there are two main minerals: Bridgmanite (Br), which is relatively strong (high viscosity), and ferropericlase (Fp), which is relatively weak (low viscosity). When a rock containing both minerals is deformed, the weak Fp grains can form interconnected layers, lowering the overall viscosity and thus weakening the whole rock. Here, we present prompting new results that show how mantle convection and Earth's evolution are affected by such a deformation‐dependent or “strain‐weakening” (SW) viscosity law, using global‐scale numerical simulations of mantle convection and plate tectonics. We find that, in particular, the dynamics of hot, rising columns of mantle material (plumes) are affected by SW rheology, making them more narrow, fast, and less hot relatively to other plumes. Finally, we find that this new types of plume dynamics could be linked to several observations of mantle plumes in the Earth. A new strain‐weakening (SW) rheology for lower mantle materials is implemented in numerical models of global‐scale mantle convection Such rheology causes weakening of plume conduits, forming narrow lubrication channels in the mantle through which hot material easily rises SW rheology in the lower mantle could explain the discrepancy between expected and observed thermal anomalies of deep mantle plumes on Earth A new strain‐weakening (SW) rheology for lower mantle materials is implemented in numerical models of global‐scale mantle convection Such rheology causes weakening of plume conduits, forming narrow lubrication channels in the mantle through which hot material easily rises SW rheology in the lower mantle could explain the discrepancy between expected and observed thermal anomalies of deep mantle plumes on Earth.","tags":null,"title":"Narrow, Fast, and “Cool” Mantle Plumes Caused by Strain‐Weakening Rheology in Earth's Lower Mantle","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The EGU General assembly is coming up next week and QuakeID team members will be part of several presentations.

Light alloying elements (e.g., Si, O, S, C, N, H) in liquid iron are particularly relevant due to the density deficit of Earth’s core, yet high P-T experimental diffusion studies involving such alloys remain scarce, with large uncertainties on the P and T dependence required for extrapolation to core conditions. In this study, we measured the chemical diffusion of carbon in liquid iron over a P-T range of 3–15 GPa and 1700–2450 K using a multi-anvil apparatus. Diffusion couples consisting of pure Fe and Fe-2.5 wt%C cylinders were placed end-to-end in an MgO capsule in a vertical orientation. Carbon concentration profiles were measured by electron microprobe and modeled numerically to correct for non-isothermal diffusion that occurred prior to reaching the peak temperature. Carbon diffusion coefficients range from 6 × 10−9 m2·s−1 to 2 × 10−8 m2·s−1, with global Arrhenian fit parameters D0 = 1.4 ± 0.5 × 10−7 m2·s−1, ΔE = 43 ± 6 kJ/mol, and ΔV = −0.06 ± 0.19 cm3·mol−1. A negligible P effect is consistent with previous studies of oxygen diffusion in liquid iron and high-T calculations but differs from larger ΔV values previously reported from carbon self-diffusion experiments for liquid Fe3C and simulations for an Fe-Ni–C alloy. Carbon diffusion coefficients determined here are approximately three times faster than those reported from Fe-Ni-C liquid simulations, which highlights the potential significance of compositional effects on mass transport properties of liquid iron alloys and the need for expanding the P-T experimental diffusion data set currently available in the literature to more complex and geologically relevant compositions.","tags":null,"title":"Experimental determination of carbon diffusion in liquid iron at high pressure","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcel Thielmann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1637143200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1637143200,"objectID":"e642c61d7e44b401939f867dfa6d410b","permalink":"https://QuakeID.github.io/talk/17-11-21-kiel/","publishdate":"2021-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/17-11-21-kiel/","section":"talk","summary":"Talk given in the Seminar Aktuelle Forschungs-Themen (SAFT) der Geophysik","tags":[],"title":"Ductile weakening as the key to plate tectonics and deep earthquakes","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Andrea Piccolo has joined the team to work on slab detachment processes and their surface expression in the European Alps.

At high pressure-temperature conditions FeOOH decomposes forming oxygen-rich fluid and different mixed valence iron oxides (previously known phases of Fe2O3, Fe3O4, Fe5O7, and novel Fe7O10 and Fe6.32O9). Rust is known to form as a byproduct of anoxygenic prokaryote metabolism that took place massively from about 3.8 billion years (Ga) ago until the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) ∼2.2 Ga ago. Rust was buried on the ocean floor and was transported into the mantle as a consequence of plate tectonics (started ∼2.8 Ga ago).

Our initial findings reveal that horizontally forced subduction zone initiation is dominant over the last 100 Ma, and that most initiation events are proximal to pre-existing subduction zones. The SZI Database is expandable to facilitate access to the most current understanding of subduction zone initiation as research progresses, providing a community platform that establishes a common language to sharpen discussion across the Earth Science community. Despite numerous advances in our understanding of subduction since the theory of plate tectonics was established, the mechanisms of subduction zone initiation remain highly controversial.

We consider a combined flow law of dislocation and diffusion creep. To understand and quantify the coupling of these three nonlinear weakening processes, we derive a mathematical model, which consists of three coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations describing the evolution of slab thickness, grain size and temperature. With dimensional analysis, we determine the dimensionless parameters which control the relative importance of the three weakening processes and the two creep mechanisms. We derive several analytical solutions for end-member scenarios that predict the detachment time, that is the duration of slab detachment until slab thickness becomes zero. These analytical solutions are then tested against numerical solutions for intermediate cases. The analytical solutions are accurate for end-member scenarios where one of the weakening mechanisms and one of the creep mechanisms is dominant. Furthermore, we use numerical solutions of the system of equations to systematically explore the parameter space with a Monte Carlo approach.. The numerical approach shows that the analytical solutions typically never deviate by more than 50% from the numerical ones, even for scenarios where all three weakening and both creep mechanisms are important. When both grain and thermal damage are important, the two damage processes generate a positive feedback loop resulting in the fastest detachment times. For Earth conditions, we find that the onset of slab detachment is controlled by grain damage and that during later stages of slab detachment thermal weakening becomes increasingly important and can become the dominating weakening process. We argue that both grain and thermal damage are important for slab detachment and that both damage processes could also be important for lithosphere necking during continental rifting leading to break-up and ocean formation.","tags":null,"title":"Contributions of Grain Damage, Thermal Weakening, and Necking to Slab Detachment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Enrico Marzotto","Wen-Pin Hsieh","Takayuki Ishii","Keng-Hsien Chao","Gregor J Golabek","Marcel Thielmann","Eiji Ohtani"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593561600,"objectID":"9d289f852e2f9184343fff673c0ac530","permalink":"https://QuakeID.github.io/publication/marzotto-2020-de/","publishdate":"2021-10-28T21:57:09.074505Z","relpermalink":"/publication/marzotto-2020-de/","section":"publication","summary":"Key Points: Ringwoodite thermal conductivity is reduced by 40% due to the presence of 1.73 wt% water in the crystal structure.

Fluid flow on different scales is of interest for several Earth science disciplines like petrophysics, hydrogeology and volcanology. To parameterize fluid flow in large-scale numerical simulations (e.g. groundwater and volcanic systems), flow properties on the microscale need to be considered. For this purpose experimental and numerical investigations of flow through porous media over a wide range of porosities are necessary. In the present study we sinter glass bead media with various porosities and measure the permeability experimentally. The microstructure, namely effective porosity and effective specific surface, is investigated using image processing. We determine flow properties like tortuosity and permeability using numerical simulations.

Nevertheless, numerical mantle convection models typically struggle to reproduce the strike-slip movement observed along transform faults on Earth. Instead, mantle convection models tend to produce mostly convergent and divergent plate boundaries. Based on regional visco-(elasto)-plastic thermomechanical models it has been demonstrated that a strong strain-induced weakening of rocks has to be assumed in order to initiate and stabilise the characteristic orthogonal ridge-transform spreading patterns. However, the physical origin of such intense rheological weakening remains unclear. Considering that in nature oceanic transform faults show a strongly reduced grain size, a potentially strong influence of grain size-reduction processes on the rheological strength of these structures can be assumed. Employing 3D thermomechanical visco-plastic models we study the effect of grain size reduction on oceanic transform fault initiation. Our results show that ductile weakening induced by grain size reduction indeed results in sufficient localisation to initiate a transform fault. Without any additional weakening mechanisms, transform faults in our models remain stable up to 2 Myr. We identify parameters that affect stability and longevity of the transform fault during the initiation phase, such as the grain damage formulation and grain growth prefactor. In our models, transform faults initiate in the brittle crust and propagate downwards, thus indicating a top-down initiated localisation process. The observed grain size, rheology and strain rate inside the shear zone of our models agree well with observations in nature; however the longevity of natural examples cannot be reached.","tags":null,"title":"Can grain size reduction initiate transform faults? - Insights from a 3D numerical study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcel Thielmann","G J Golabek","H Marquardt"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"8e56527aed3c79389268f651b952565c","permalink":"https://QuakeID.github.io/publication/thielmann-2020-ab/","publishdate":"2021-10-28T21:57:09.075402Z","relpermalink":"/publication/thielmann-2020-ab/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract The rheological properties of Earth's lower mantle play a key role for global mantle dynamics. The mineralogy of the lower mantle can be approximated as a bridgmanite-ferropericlase mixture. Previous work has suggested that the deformation of this mixture might be dramatically affected by the large differences in viscosity between bridgmanite and ferropericlase. Here, we employ numerical models to establish a connection between ferropericlase morphology and the effective rheology of the Earth's lower mantle using a numerical-statistical approach. Using this approach, we link the statistical properties of the two-phase composite to its effective viscosity tensor using analytical approximations. We find that ferropericlase develops elongated structures within the bridgmanite matrix that result in significantly lowered viscosity. While our findings confirm previous endmember models that suggested a change of mantle viscosity due to the formation of interconnected weak layers, we show that significant rheological weakening can thus be already achieved even when ferropericlase does not form an interconnected network. Additionally, the alignment of weak ferropericlase leads to a pronounced viscous anisotropy that develops with total strain, which may have implications for understanding the viscosity structure of Earth's lower mantle as well as for modeling the behavior of subducting slabs. We show that to capture the effect of ferropericlase elongation on the effective viscosity tensor (and its anisotropy) in large-scale mantle convection models, the analytical approximations that have been derived to describe the evolution of the effective viscosity of a two-phase medium with aligned elliptical inclusions can be used.","tags":null,"title":"Ferropericlase Control of Lower Mantle Rheology: Impact of Phase Morphology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Simone Papa","Giorgio Pennacchioni","Luca Menegon","Marcel Thielmann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"629b91d1471cc116fdd3d1cd50e2db27","permalink":"https://QuakeID.github.io/publication/papa-2020116260/","publishdate":"2021-10-28T21:57:09.076875Z","relpermalink":"/publication/papa-2020116260/","section":"publication","summary":"Coeval pseudotachylytes (solidified melts produced during seismic slip) and mylonites are generally regarded as the geological record of transient seismic events during dominant ductile flow. Thermal runaway has been proposed as a model to explain the pseudotachylyte-mylonite association. In the Mont Mary unit (Western Alps), pseudotachylyte fault veins occur along the amphibolite-facies (ca. 550°C; 0.35 GPa) ultramylonitic foliation of paragneisses. These veins formed at the same metamorphic conditions of the ultramylonites, thus potentially recording thermal runaway. We analysed the microstructure of quartz in ultramylonite and of ultramylonite clasts in pseudotachylyte to investigate the possible occurrence of thermal runaway. Quartz aggregates show an evolution under constant temperature to ultrafine-grained recrystallised grain size (2.5 $μ$m), reflecting creep under high differential stresses (\u003e 200 MPa) and high strain rates (10textminus9 stextminus1), along very narrow foliation-parallel layers. In the ultrafine aggregates, viscous grain boundary sliding became dominant and promoted cavitation leading to disintegration of quartz aggregates and precipitation, in the pore space, of biotite, oriented parallel to the main ultramylonitic foliation. The strain rate-limiting process was aseismic fluid-assisted precipitation of biotite. The potential occurrence, at the deformation conditions of the Mont Mary ultramylonites, of thermal runaway in pure quartz layers was investigated by numerical modelling. The models predict a switch from stable flow to thermal runaway at background strain rates faster than 10textminus9 stextminus1 for critical differential stresses that are comparable to the brittle strength of rocks. Deformation of ultramylonites occurred close to the conditions for thermal runaway to occur, but based on the microstructural record we conclude that the Mont Mary pseudotachylyte-mylonite association is best explained by brittle failure, triggered by transients of high differential stress and strain rate causing a downward deflection of the brittle-ductile transition.","tags":null,"title":"High-stress creep preceding coseismic rupturing in amphibolite-facies ultramylonites","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1574076000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574076000,"objectID":"0439de7bc3878f28bc10e0645d2a88f7","permalink":"https://QuakeID.github.io/talk/private/talkdeepearth2019/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/private/talkdeepearth2019/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Ferropericlase control of lower mantle rheology - Impact of phase morphology","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572566400,"objectID":"6c4d2cdebde90a2ae8807c9d6e22d116","permalink":"https://QuakeID.github.io/talk/private/talketh2019/","publishdate":"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/private/talketh2019/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Earthquakes and plate tectonics - the importance of ductile weakening mechanisms","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Marcel Thielmann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559413200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559413200,"objectID":"3077f8101993267914cc6e755e777c42","permalink":"https://QuakeID.github.io/talk/private/talkvolatiles2019/","publishdate":"2019-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/private/talkvolatiles2019/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Ferropericlase control of lower mantle rheology - Impact of phase morphology","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559214900,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559214900,"objectID":"3f062704c6681a4fcc033355984cf36b","permalink":"https://QuakeID.github.io/talk/private/talkjpgu2019/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/private/talkjpgu2019/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Deep intraslab earthquake rupture due to grain size assisted thermal runaway","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1557489600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557489600,"objectID":"c086835c51666333e08bb7e39fd15270","permalink":"https://QuakeID.github.io/talk/private/talkras2019/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/private/talkras2019/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Earthquakes below the brittle–ductile transition - The role of grain size assisted thermal runaway","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1549018800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549018800,"objectID":"6e36425b38d41756a306b1d68fbcd41f","permalink":"https://QuakeID.github.io/talk/private/talkcreep2019/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/private/talkcreep2019/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Deforming two-phase media - From Topology to Rheology","type":"talk"},{"authors":["P Eichheimer","Marcel Thielmann","A Popov","G J Golabek","W Fujita","M O Kottwitz","Boris J P Kaus"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"bda427e01b37f06c66ab21a5aa9938bb","permalink":"https://QuakeID.github.io/publication/eichheimer-2019-sj/","publishdate":"2021-10-28T21:57:09.078594Z","relpermalink":"/publication/eichheimer-2019-sj/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Pore-scale permeability prediction for Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Filippo Bianchi","Marcel Thielmann","Lucilla de Arcangelis","Hans Jürgen Herrmann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"81d5a18691406a160f3a410eb70069fe","permalink":"https://QuakeID.github.io/publication/bianchi-2018-gg/","publishdate":"2021-10-28T21:57:09.079091Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bianchi-2018-gg/","section":"publication","summary":"Particle detachment bursts during the flow of suspensions through porous media are a phenomenon that can severely affect the efficiency of deep bed filters.

We find that the burst size distribution scales consistently with a power law, suggesting that we are in the presence of a novel experimental realization of a self-organized critical system.

The Hindu Kush–Pamir orogenic system at the western end of the Himalayan orogen provides a rare example of continental collision linked to two opposing intra-continental subduction zones. The subducted plates feature a peculiar 3D geometry consisting of two distinct lithospheric fragments with different polarities, subduction angles and slab-curvatures beneath the Hindu Kush and Pamir, respectively. Using 3D geodynamic modeling, we simulate possible development of two opposing continental subduction zones to understand the dynamic evolution of the Hindu Kush–Pamir orogenic system. Our geodynamic model reproduces the major tectonic elements observed: (1) the deeper subduction depth, the steeper dip angle and the southward offset of the Hindu Kush subduction zone relative to the Pamir naturally occur if convergence direction of the subducting Indian plate and dip-direction of the Hindu Kush subduction zone match. (2) The formation of the highly asymmetrically curved Pamir region and the south-dipping subduction is promoted by the initial geometry of the indenting Indian lithosphere together with the existence of a major strike-slip fault on the eastern margin of the Pamir region. (3) Subduction of only the lower continental crust during continental collision can occur if the coupling between upper and lower crusts is weak enough to allow a separation of these two components, and that (4) the subduction of mainly lower crust then facilitates that conditions for intermediate-depth seismicity can be reached. (5) The secondary tectonic features modeled here such as strike-slip-fault growth, north–northwest striking extension zone, and lateral flow of the thickened ductile upper crust are comparable to the current tectonics of the region. (6) Model results are further compared to the potentially similar orogenic system, i.e., the Alpine orogen, in terms of the curved Western Alpine arc and the two opposing subducted slabs beneath the Alps and the Dinarides.","tags":null,"title":"3D geodynamic models for the development of opposing continental subduction zones: The Hindu Kush–Pamir example","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

The method is attractive as it easily allows employment of body-fitted deformable meshes and a true free surface boundary condition. However, when a Lagrangian mesh is used, remeshing becomes necessary at large strains to avoid numerical inaccuracies (or even wrong results) due to severely distorted elements. For this reason, the FE method is oftentimes combined with the particle-in-cell (PIC) method, where particles are introduced which track history variables and store constitutive information. This implies that the respective material properties have to be interpolated from the particles to the inte- gration points of the finite elements. In numerical geodynamics, material parameters (in particular the viscosity) usually vary over a large range. This may be due to strongly temperature-dependent rheologies (which result in large but smooth viscosity variations) or material interfaces (which result in viscosity jumps). Here, we analyze the accuracy and convergence properties of velocity and pressure of the hybrid FE-PIC method in the presence of large viscosity variations. Standard interpolation schemes (arithmetic and harmonic) are compared to a more sophisticated interpolation scheme which is based on linear least squares interpolation for two types of elements (Q1 P0 and Q2 P_1 ). In the case of a smooth viscosity field, the accuracy and convergence is significantly improved by the new interpolation scheme. In the presence of viscosity jumps, the order of accuracy is strongly decreased.","tags":null,"title":"Discretization Errors in the Hybrid Finite Element Particle-in-cell Method","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Karoly Hidas","Carlos J Garrido","Andrea Tommasi","José Alberto Padron-Navarta","Marcel Thielmann","Z Konc","E Frets","C Marchesi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1372636800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1372636800,"objectID":"f9f4da42f62b53d75cb19abb7fc507f4","permalink":"https://QuakeID.github.io/publication/hidas-2013-ey/","publishdate":"2021-10-28T21:57:09.083595Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hidas-2013-ey/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract We report structural evidence of ductile strain localization in mantle pyroxenite from the spinel to plagioclase websterite transition in the Ronda Peridotite (southern Spain).
