 abstract = {Key Points: Ringwoodite thermal conductivity is reduced by 40% due to the presence of 1.73 wt% water in the crystal structure. Lower thermal conductivity of hydrous ringwoodite might delay the breakdown of hydrous phases hosted in a subducting slab. Hydrous ringwoodite acts as a heat propagation barrier, supporting preservation of hydrous minerals down to the lower mantle.},
